# Dear Diary
## Inspiration
---
> The toll of the pandemic has greatly affected women in their personal and professional lives. Our goal was to create a simple and creative outlet for users to express themselves, document their feelings, and relieve stress or anxiety. We wanted to create a platform to improve users' mental health through a progressive timeline of a daily video dairy and affirmations that empower users in difficult times. 

## What it does
---
> We created a web-app for a video diary, in which you have the option to create a daily entry or affirmation. The affirmations currently includes two options to record yourself stating:

> *"Today I am a Leader" or "Today I am Powerful"*

> The dairy records users thoughts and affirmations, and we hope the creative outlet can provide a sense of comfort or confidence in oneself. The timeline can allow you to revisit memories and see how your mental state has personally developed.
